# Node-RED Custom Nodes for Data Processing and Communication

## Overview

This project involves creating custom Node-RED nodes to efficiently process and parse data, manage communication with servers, and log information. The nodes are designed to handle specific protocols and time constraints while allowing for extensive configuration options. The system enables real-time data handling and integration with servers through a well-defined protocol.

## Features

- **Custom Nodes**: Designed for processing, parsing, and communicating data with servers.
- **Configuration Options**: Each node supports configurable properties such as module ID, IP address, destination port, local port, device MAC, device ID, module type, and more.
- **Time Management**: Adheres to strict time constraints to ensure timely data processing and communication.
- **Logging**: Stores data in log files for historical analysis and troubleshooting.

## Components

- **Flow File**: A Node-RED flow file containing the custom nodes and their configurations.
- **README File**: Provides detailed instructions on how to install and use the custom nodes.
- **PNG File**: Visual representation of the node features and configurations.

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download**: Get the project files from the repository.
2. **Import Flow into Node-RED**: Import the Node-RED flow file to integrate all custom nodes into your Node-RED environment.
   - Go to the Node-RED editor.
   - Click on the menu (three horizontal lines) and select "Import".
   - Choose the flow file and import it.

3. **Export and Install Nodes Individually**:
   - Export each custom node from Node-RED as a single package.
   - Use the following command to install the custom nodes individually:
     ```bash
     npm install <path-to-node-package>
     ```

## Usage

1. **Configure Nodes**: Set up each node with the required configuration parameters including module ID, IP address, ports, device MAC, and other relevant settings.
2. **Deploy Flow**: Deploy the Node-RED flow to start processing data and communicating with the server.
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check the log files for data storage and troubleshooting information.
